        <h2>"Burnt Toast"</h2>
        Aiden Sage <br>
        

        <br>
        A slice once golden, now charred black,<br>
        Dreams of butter can’t bring it back. <br>
        Edges curled, a brittle frame, <br>
        A quiet witness to the flame. <br>
        <br>
        Crumbs fall like ashes, soft and light, <br>
        From a battle lost to heat’s fierce fight. <br>
        The scent of smoke, a sharp refrain, <br>
        A morning’s hope now tinged with pain. <br>
        <br>
        The toaster sang, the clock struck loud, <br>
        A year’s last meal, beneath a shroud. <br>
        Distracted thoughts, reflections deep, <br>
        Turned bread to coal while hearts did leap. <br>
        <br>
        For New Year’s Eve, with cheers and wine, <br>
        We toast the past, the flawed design. <br>
        Each burnt mistake, each effort failed, <br>
        The storms endured, the ships derailed. <br>
        <br>
        Yet even toast that bears the scars, <br>
        Can teach us truths beneath the char. <br>
        A lesson whispered through the haze: <br>
        That missteps forge the brighter days. <br>
        <br>
        So as we watch the ball descend, <br>
        And bid farewell to what must end, <br>
        We lift our toast—both burned and bright— <br>
        To every stumble, every fight. <br>
        <br>
        For New Year’s comes, a second chance, <br>
        A brand-new song, a hopeful dance. <br>
        And though the bread may burn once more, <br>
        We’ll keep on striving, as before. <br><br>
